Friends, Romans, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Ceasar, not to praise him.
The evil men do lives after them;
The good is oft intered with their bones;
So let it be with Ceasar.  The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Ceasar Answer'd it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest-
For brutus is an honorable man;
So are they all, all honorable
Beware the ides of March,
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
Come I to speak in Ceasar's funeral.
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
He hath bought many captives to Rome,
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Ceasar hath wept:
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;

You all did see that on the Luperval
I thrice presented him a queenly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And, sure, he is an honorable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause:
What cause withholds you then to mourn mourn for him?
O judgement!
   thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason.  Bear with me;
My heart is in the cheap wooden box there with Ceasar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.
